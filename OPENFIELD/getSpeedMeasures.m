function [meanSpeed, maxSpeed, locoTime, totalDistance, totalDistanceLocomoting, meanSpeedLocomoting, instSpeeds, isLocomoting] = getSpeedMeasures(mouseTrajectory, FRAMERATE, dataDescriptor)
%GETSPEEDMEASURES Calculate various speed measures from a mouse trajectory.
%
%   [instSpeeds, meanSpeed, maxSpeed, locoTime, totalDistance, totalDistanceLocomoting, meanSpeedLocomoting] = GETSPEEDMEASURES(mouseTrajectory, FRAMERATE, dataDescriptor)
%   calculates the instantaneous speeds, mean speed, max speed, locomotion time, total distance, total distance while locomoting, and mean speed while locomoting from the input mouse trajectory. It also optionally takes a data descriptor for plot labeling.
%
%   Inputs:
%   - mouseTrajectory: A gap-filled (nan-free) trajectory from which we
%   want speed. Can be 1D, 2D, or 3D. Assumed to be in mm.
%   - FRAMERATE: The framerate of the data.
%   - dataDescriptor (optional): A string to be used as a label in the plot title.
%
%   Outputs:
%   - instSpeeds: A single-column vector with instantaneous speeds (mm/sec).
%   - meanSpeed: Mean speed of the mouse.
%   - maxSpeed: Maximum speed of the mouse.
%   - locoTime: Time spent locomoting (in seconds), defined as the time the instantaneous speed was above a threshold (default 40).
%   - totalDistance: Total distance traveled by the mouse.
%   - totalDistanceLocomoting: Total distance traveled by the mouse while locomoting.
%   - meanSpeedLocomoting: Mean speed of the mouse while locomoting.
